# ReadMe with workflow
The script called run_analysis.R must be in the same dir than "UCI HAR Dataset" folder, not inside this.

Please read the Code Book before start or run the script.

The code can run without modify anything, but it is recomended to read the full code to understand how it works.

After all the analysis you will have a file in the same folder than the script called "tidyDataset.txt", that is created in step five.
